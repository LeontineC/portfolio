            <p className='textAbout'>Hi, I'm Leontine, welcome to my portfolio. It's definitely a work in progress. Follow me on my journey as I learn and develop. 
                I am currently enrolled in the web development program at TechGrounds and wish to become a front end developer. My goal is to master
                 HTML and CSS, to become a dab hand in Javascript and become completely familiar with React. I like to make my work look visually appealing and have discovered my creative side. I want to make 
                 things that look amazing! As a person, I am rather modest and a bit of a softie. A dosage of humor, cats, coffee and jelly beans all make me smile. </p>
